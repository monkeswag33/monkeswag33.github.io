    PivotOS, my custom operating system, started its journey in April 2023. After going to multiple iterations and multiple programming languages, I finally settled on Assembly and C. It has many features, such as a memory manager, multitasking and multiprocessing. It has taught me a lot about low level programming, memory, and debugging. As of right now, I am still interested in implementing more features in my operating system.

    I started this project in October 2022. While learning about compression algorithms and CMake, I decided to create a tool like tar, that would take in a directory and compress it to a file. It is written in C and while it is a small project, it taught me a lot about compression and archiving tools.

    While learning about Zig and Huffman Coding, I wanted to experiment with it. Huffman Coding works by representing each byte as a combination of bits, so if a file uses the same characters multiple times, they can be represented by less than 8 bits. Through this project, I learned a lot about compression algorithms.
