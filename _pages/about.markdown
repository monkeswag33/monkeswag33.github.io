      My name is Ishan Karmakar and I am in 8th grade at Canyon Ridge Middle School in Austin, TX. When I'm not doing homework, you can find me playing sports, or playing flight simulators.

    title: "Programming"
    excerpt: >
      I started learning to program in 2020, during the pandemic. My first language was Scratch, a block programming language. I moved on to Python, which was much more powerful and still simple to use. My interest in programming led me to explore other languages such as C++, Javascript, and C, and I started learning the deeper workings of computers. Eventually, I discovered that I loved backend programming and low level languages. I found that it was fascinating to work directly with the computer, without any abstractions.

    title: "Interests"
    excerpt: >
      I have many different interests. In my free time, I love to play tennis with my friends and play tournaments. I also love to play the piano and I have been playing it since first grade. As a logical person, I turn to robotics, building and competing with robots in both FLL and FTC. I love to explore the world in Microsoft Flight Simulator. Finally, I love to travel, read books, listen to music, and watch movies in my free time.
