    excerpt: >
      PivotOS, my custom operating system, started its journey in April 2023. After going to multiple iterations and multiple programming languages, I finally settled on Assembly and C. It has many features, such as a memory manager, multitasking and multiprocessing. It has taught me a lot about low level programming, memory, and debugging. As of right now, I am still interested in implementing more features in my operating system.
